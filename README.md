<h2>➕ Adding and managing glosses</h2>
<p>Firstly, make sure you are signed in to Gallery of Glosses. </p>

<p>To add a gloss to the site, go to <b>🆕 New gloss</b> in the navigation bar at the top of the page or click <b>Create a New Gloss</b> on the home page. You should be taken to the new gloss form. This is the place where you document the full text of an individual gloss, give it a label (incipit or other), identify what text it is glossing (by a canonical reference locator, such as John 1:1), and assign tags or themes to the gloss.</p>

<p>When filling out this form, it is important to describe the gloss as well as possible. Additionally, the gloss you are adding should not already exist in Gallery of Glosses. To view existing glosses, head to <b>✏️ Glosses</b> through the navigation bar or <b>Browse Gloss Collection</b> on the home page.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the form, you have the option to add tags of your choice (such as key terms, persons, rhetorical techniques, citations) or associate a gloss with a particular research theme. Perhaps most importantly, you then can add one or multiple textual witnesses to the gloss. If you have transcribed glosses from a manuscript in T-PEN, click on "Add a T-PEN Transcription Witness for this Gloss." If your gloss comes from a printed edition, manuscript not uploaded into T-PEN, or some other source, click on "Add a Textual Witness for this Gloss."</p>

<h2>🔎 Detecting a gloss with T-PEN</h2>
<p>On Gallery of Glosses, you can insert a Transcription Witness using T-PEN manifest URIs. If you have a desired transcription text via URI to use for a gloss, go to <b>🔍 Detect glosses</b> and enter it in the text box. Then, click the <b>Load TPEN Manifest</b> button.</p>

<p>Once your T-PEN transcription loads, you can begin to attach sections of transcription to glosses, identifying a chunk of text as constituting Gloss A in this textual witness. Simply highlight the text of a gloss and click on >attach. Make sure the manuscript shelfmark is put in the box above, and edit the text of the gloss, as needed, to match the particular variants of your manuscript.</p>
